# Turkish-User-Story-NLP

This is a Turkish user stories inconsistency detection project. 

## Introduction and Motivation

  User stories state the ideas of requirements what an end-user expects from the system. So they are of great importance in defining the requirements of a system. User stories that are not clear enough and have inconsistencies among user stories may cause problems during implementation of the system. For this reason, it is important to remove the inconsistencies in the user story requirements in order to increase the quality of the project and to prevent problems that may arise later. Although trying to find these inconsistencies manually is a solution, it may not always give the best solution. We can use NLP techniques for inconsistency detection in order to avoid undesired situations. At the same time, the use of developed NLP techniques significantly reduces the time required to detect inconsistency compared to manual detection which increases the efficiency. With this project, we aimed to create a tool that detects inconsistencies and incompleteness  in Turkish user stories with high precision.
	
  We know that software engineering is not just a development process. It is also crucial to determine the user needs with a feasible solution. Sometimes end users ask for some features which are not possible to implement or their costs can be too high for the project budget. These kinds of conflicts occur because of different reasons such as not knowing the implementation phase of the application so much or not understanding the real users needs. 
Determining these needs manually is not the solution we want or for a better explanation, we may miss some of the inconsistencies with human eyes. Therefore, we have decided to implement a project which detects inconsistencies and incompleteness in Turkish user stories better than any human process. We believe that this algorithm is highly valuable for the companies that develop applications with agile methods. Because, both companies and customers lose time and money while trying to implement some features which are not possible or not worth implementing.
